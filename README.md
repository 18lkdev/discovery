Discovery is a based service that is production-ready and primarily used at [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

## Quick Start

### env

### build
```shell
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p github.com/Bilibili
cd $GOPATH/github.com/Bilibili
git clone https://github.com/Bilibili/discovery.git
cd discovery/cmd/discovery
go build
```
